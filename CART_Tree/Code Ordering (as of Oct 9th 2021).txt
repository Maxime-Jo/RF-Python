Order of code:
1. Transform categorical: transform categorical to continuous
2. Measure Purity: purity measurs to find best split
3. Split search: find best split point based on purity measure
4. Best cut: find which variable to use to create split based on split purity
5. Node creation: creates tree and returns node obs is apart of at each stage (also identifies best split at each node and returns it)
6. Train prediction: makes prediction on training set based on terminal node of each obs.
